you happy. i'm no ones first choice.second choice.third choice.fourth.fifth.sixth.seventh.eighth.honestly, i'm not even anyones last choice. i honestly do care for everyone. i love you, because i know how it feels to not be loved, to be alone. i don't want you feeling how i feel. i'm the upbeat girl that always has a smile on her face, that can always be counted on to hold you while you cry, but i'll never be okay. when you start to see hip bones&gt; it just proves that i'm not loved by my so called "friends" thats why i keep to myself. usually that wouldn't seem bad, but i have never missed
